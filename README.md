- 👋 Hi, We're HEATDAO.
- 😮 Currently, users in blockchain-based immersive virtual worlds are limited to the default emotes for each virtual world. 
- 🛠️ We're here to fix that.
- 🙌 We are adding a new layer of self-expression to the metaverse.
- 🤯 Our movement data marketplace will allow anyone to monetize animation files.
- 💃 The animation data will be visually represented by one of our default skeletons, which can be minted as an NFT to the marketplace.
- 😀 Holding a movement data NFT in your wallet will enable users to call that animation data in each of the blockchain based virtual worlds.
- 🥁 The result...unlimited possibilities for new emotes in the metaverse.
